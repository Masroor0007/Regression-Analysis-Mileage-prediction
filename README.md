## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to employ regression analysis in order to predict car mileage. Regression analysis, a statistical modeling technique, is utilized to estimate the correlation between mileage and a range of other variables. By analyzing the dataset and constructing a regression model, this project seeks to forecast car mileage based on different predictor variables.

## Data Source

For this project, the dataset employed is obtained from StatLibrary, a repository maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. It encompasses a multitude of variables pertaining to cars, encompassing mileage, engine size, weight, horsepower, and other relevant aspects. The dataset plays a crucial role in enabling accurate mileage prediction through regression analysis.
